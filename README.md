# HiLo

Are you willing to risk everything? Play HiLo and you might be surprised. The rules are simple. Draw a card. Guess if the next card will be higher or lower. Guess correctly, and earn 100 points. Guess incorrectly and lose 75 points. As long as you have more than 0 points, you can keep playing. If not the game is over.

## Getting Started
